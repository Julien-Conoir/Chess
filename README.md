# Myg Chess Game

This is a chess game for Pharo based on Bloc, Toplo and Myg.

## What is this repository really about

The goal of this repository is not to be a complete full blown game, but a good enough implementation to practice software engineering skills:
 - testing
 - reading existing code
 - refactorings
 - profiling
 - debugging

## Getting started

### Getting the code

This code has been tested in Pharo 12. You can get it by installing the following baseline code:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
	repository: 'github://UnivLille-Meta/Chess:main';
	baseline: 'MygChess';
	onConflictUseLoaded;
	load.
```

### Using it

You can open the chess game using the following expression:

```smalltalk
board := MyChessGame freshGame.
board size: 800@600.
space := BlSpace new.
space root addChild: board.
space pulse.
space resizable: true.
space show.
```

## Relevant Design Points

This repository contains:
 - a chess model: the board/squares, the pieces, their movements, how they threat each other
 - a UI using Bloc and Toplo: a board is rendered as bloc UI elements. Each square is a UI element that contains a selection, an optional piece. Pieces are rendered using a text element and a special chess font (https://github.com/joshwalters/open-chess-font/tree/master).
 - Textual game importers for the PGN and FEN standards (see https://ia902908.us.archive.org/26/items/pgn-standard-1994-03-12/PGN_standard_1994-03-12.txt and https://www.chessprogramming.org/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation#Samples)

### Fix pawn moves!
## Maureen's Job
**Goal:** Practice debugging and testing

Pawns are one of the most complicated pieces of chess to implement.
They move forward, one square at a time, except for their first movement.
However, they can move diagonally to capture other pieces.
And in addition, there is the (in)famous "En passant" move that complicates everything (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant, and the FEN documentation for ideas on how to encode this information https://www.chessprogramming.org/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation#En_passant_target_square).
As any *complicated* feature, the original developer (Guille P) left this for the end, and then left the project.
But you can do it.

Questions and ideas that can help you in the process:
- Can you write tests showing the bugs?

The tests I wrote at the beginning of the project shown me that pawn could attack a piece forward itself but not in diagonal (like it's the rules). A pawn could only move forward one square by one and attack pieces of it color.
- What kind of tools can you use to spot the bug?

I wrote tests and play the game to spot the bugs.
- Can you approach this incrementally? This is, splitting this task in many subtasks. How would you prioritize them?

I first fix the problem of the first move, then the simple attack and the problem with wich color to attack or not. I finished by try to code the "En Passant".

## What I finished
I success to code and test the first move, the basic move and the simple attack of the pawn. As I explained during the presentation, I made a Strategy Pattern that is re-usable for the moves of the other pieces.

I started to code the "En Passant" attack but did not succeed to finish.

### Refactor piece rendering
## Julien's job
**Goal:** Practice refactorings, double dispatch and table dispatch

The game renders pieces with methods that look like these:

```smalltalk
MyChessSquare >> renderKnight: aPiece

	^ aPiece isWhite
		  ifFalse: [ color isBlack
				  ifFalse: [ 'M' ]
				  ifTrue: [ 'm' ] ]
		  ifTrue: [
			  color isBlack
				  ifFalse: [ 'N' ]
				  ifTrue: [ 'n' ] ]
```
As any project done in stress during a short period of time (a couple of evenings when the son is sick), the original developer (Guille P) was not 100% following coding standards and quality recommendations.
We would like you to clean up this rendering logic and remove as much conditionals as possible, for the sake of it.
You can do it.

Questions and ideas that can help you in the process:
- Can you do an implementation with double dispatch?
- Can you do an implementation with table dispatch?
- What are the good and bad parts of them in *this scenario*? Do you understand why?
